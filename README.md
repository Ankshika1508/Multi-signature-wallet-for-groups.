# Decentralized Skill Certification

## Project Title
Decentralized Skill Certification

## Project Description
A blockchain-based platform where users can earn verified skill certifications through smart contracts, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraudulent credentials. By leveraging decentralized networks, the system eliminates the risk of certificate forgery and ensures trust among employers, educators, and students. Users can receive certifications directly from authorized issuers, and these certificates are permanently recorded on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
